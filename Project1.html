					<p>Learning is a journey from being a <b>Novice</b> to becoming an <b>Expert</b> which we can consider to have four destinct phases.</p>
					<h4>The Stages of Expertise</h4>
						<ol start="0">
							<li><b>Ignorance</b> - No knowledge of the subject at all.</li>
							<li><b>Awareness</b> - The point at which you become aware that a subject exists.</li>
							<li><b>Ability</b> - When you can do something but it requires effort and focus to achieve.</li>
							<li><b>Fluency</b> - Knowledge so complete that it comes as easily as breathing.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The journey is an interesting one BUT the time taken from one stage to the next varies significantly depending on the complexity of the subject in question.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>From Ignorance to Awareness - a journey measured in seconds/minutes</li>
							<li>From Awareness to Ability - a journey measured in minutes/days.</li>
							<li>From Ability to Expert - a journey measured in days/weeks/months/years!!!</li>
						</ul>
						<p><b>Remember:</b> Use the online resources available to you (<em>forums, etc.</em>) to ask for help if you are struggling - Don't give up! <b>You CAN do this!</b>'</p>

					<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of webpages, images and interactive content (<em>Web applications</em>) 
					connected together by links (<em><b>Hyperlink</b>s - commonly abbreviated to link</em>)  .</p>
					<h4>Key Components of the Web:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The Browser on My Computer</li>
						<li>The  Webserver - located 'out there' - on the Cloud</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These two elements communicate via <b>HTTP</b> (<em><b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol</em>).  The browser sends a request and the webserver returns the requested webpage.</p>
					<h4>How does the webserver know which page to the browser?</h4>
					<p>The browser requests a page by clicking on a Hyperlink which contains a reference to a <b>URL</b> (<em><b>U</b>niorm <b>R</b>esource <b>L</b>ocator</em>) which is <b>unique</b> to each page on the web.</p>

					<p>The content of an HTML Document is made up of Elements.</p>
					<p>All Elements are rectangluar in shape.</p>
					<p>HTML &lt;tags&gt; are used to markup these Elements.</p>
					<p>These &lt;tags&gt; tell the browser how to handle the individual elements of the webpage.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Most Elements are written with an opening tag, content and a closing tag.</dt>
							<dd>eg. <b>&lt;tag&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;.</b></dd>
						<dt>In addition, some elements (like images and links) can have (an) attribute(s) which have names and values.</dt>
							<dd>eg. <b>&lt;tag attributeName="value"&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;</b></dd>
						<dt>There are also a number of tags which are referred to as <b>void tags</b>.  These tags don't have either content or a closing tag.</dt>
							<dd>Examples:</dd>
							<dd><b>The image element: &lt;img src="<em>url</em>" alt="text" &gt;</b></dd>
							<dd>(note: the 'alt' attribute is not compulsory but is important as it is what will be displayed if there is an error/break in the link to the image url.  It is also helpful for blind users.)</dd>
							<dd><b>The Line Break element: &lt;br&gt;</b></dd>
					</dl>
					<h4>There are two major types or elements:</h4>

						<dt><b>Inline Elements</b></dt>
							<dd>Simple in nature and have only content and occupy only the space they need.</dd>
						<dt><b>Block Elements</b></dt>
							<dd>Contained within a virtual box and have height and width attributes as well as other potential. <br> <b><em>By default they occupy the full width of the webpage</em></b>.</dd>

						<li>HTML elements are rectangular in shape (<em>can be considered to be boxes</em>)</li>
						<li><b>HTML has a tree-like structure</b>. HTML element content can be simple text, images or other elements (<em>boxes within boxes</em>).  Similar to a family tree elements within the tree can have child elements and/or parent elements.</li>

				<span><a id="topic3.1">What is CSS and how does it work?</a></span>
				<div class="topicContent">
						<p>CSS is code written to control the 'style' of HTML elements.</p>
						<p>Styles are applied to Element types.  The element types are all the predefined elements of HTML + any user-defined types known as classes.</p>
						<p>In order for CSS to know which styles to apply to which elements we need to use a <b><em>selector</em></b>. For example: <b>h1</b> or <b>div</b><br>
						followed by the attributes and values we want applied to those elements contained within curly braces.<br><br><em>
						h1 {<br>
							&nbsp; &nbsp; background-color : black;<br>
							&nbsp; &nbsp; color: white:<br>
						}</em></p>

			<div class="topic">
				<span><a id="topic3.2">How is CSS included on a web page?</a></span>
				<div class="topicContent">
					<p>There are 3 methods for applying styles with CSS.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>In-line in your HTML</b>
							<dl>
								<dt>Should only be considered if there is some style attribute that needs to be applied which is exclusive to that particlar instance of that particular class/element. Otherwise it is an extremely inefficient method of coding style information.</dt>
									<dd>Within the body of your HTML <b>&lt;tag style="background-color: green"&gt;content&lt;tag&gt;</b></dd>
							</dl>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Include the main block of your CSS within the &lt;head&gt; element of your HTML.</b>
							<dl>
								<dt>Can be considered when the website in question has a very small number of HTML files. </dt>
									<dd>Add a <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> element within the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> element.  The content part of the <b>&lt;style&gt;content&lt;/style&gt;</b> element should be entered as you would if you were creating a separate CSS file.</dd>
							</dl>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Link your HTML to a separate CSS file within the &lt;head&gt; element of your HTML</b>
							<dl>
								<dt>Write a separate CSS file and link it within the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> element of your HTML.  This is the preferred method when dealing with larger projects as it enables you to put all the standardized style features in one place and apply them across multiple pages giving a uniform look and feel to a whole website.  From an efficiency point of view too, the whole look and feel of a website can be updated extremely quickly by making changes on the master styles contained within the website CSS file(s).</dt>
									<dd>Add a <b>&lt;link&gt;</b> element within your <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> element of your HTML on each page of your website.</dd>
									<dd><b>&lt;head&gt;</b></dd>
									<dd><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyleSheet.css"&gt;</b></dd>
									<dd><b>&lt;/head&gt;</b></dd>
									<dd>Now in the same folder have a file called <em>myStyleSheet.css</em> which contains your CSS.</dd>
							</dl>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>There are valid reasons for using each of these methods.</p>
